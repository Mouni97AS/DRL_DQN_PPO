# Deep Reinforcement Learning based Autonomous Driving Agents


## About the Project
The main objective of this thesis is to provide a comprehensive analysis of current approaches for training autonomous vehicle agents using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). And our key contribution is to present two working implementations of DRL algorithms. First, we present a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based agent capable of reliably learning to drive in the CARLA urban driving simulator. Second, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to teach an agent to drive in a driving-like environment (CarRacing-v0)

## DRL deep-Q-Network in CARLA 

The implementation was written in Python 3.7 and TensorFlow 1.14 with Keras 2.2.4.
[CALRA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases) version 0.9.4
The code configuration and setup Carla was done on my own PC using PyCharm
